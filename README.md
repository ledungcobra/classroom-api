## Introduction of the project
 An app for everyone to create classrooms like Google Classroom. The difference is it has a feature for teachers to upload Excel for mapping student code in school to the student account and upload their grade based on their student code. 
 In addition, it supports creating grade review requests in which students and teachers can comment and get responses in real-time through WebSocket.
